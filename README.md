# eddy.sh
A centralized developer onboarding tool.

## preface
Please note that this readme was generated by a LLM, if you want to see my nonchalant take on it, please reference this commit -> [21bc810](https://github.com/kurekszymon/eddy.sh/commit/21bc810a504018cdca6c721becd6766c6d67a2e4)

## Overview
`eddy.sh` aims to simplify and standardize the process of setting up developer workstations. Instead of relying on scattered documentation, tribal knowledge, or outdated wiki pages, `eddy.sh` provides a repeatable, version-controlled approach using configuration files.

Currently, it supports macOS and Windows.

## Getting Started
Download the appropriate eddy binary for your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/kurekszymon/eddy.sh/releases) page.
(Note: At this stage, only macOS and Windows are supported.)

Create or obtain a valid `.yml` configuration file that defines the tools and environments needed for your project.

Run `eddy` with the configuration file to set up the system automatically.

## Why eddy.sh?
In many teams, onboarding involves navigating outdated or fragmented setup guides—often written informally or buried in internal wikis. Even when scripts exist to automate parts of the setup, they tend to become stale or overly specific to individual environments.

`eddy.sh` was built to address this problem. By defining tool and environment requirements in a structured `.yml` file, you can:

- Reduce the time it takes to onboard new developers—from days to minutes.
- Ensure consistency across machines and team members.
- Adapt quickly to changing requirements or tooling.

## Vision
In the future, `eddy.sh` aims to support system scanning. Running a command like `eddy.sh scan` could generate a `.yml` file based on your current environment—making it easy to share configurations with new team members.

## Current Capabilities
With a prepared `.yml` file i.e. [config.yml](https://github.com/kurekszymon/eddy.sh/blob/main/config.yaml), you can fully configure a new developer's environment in just a few minutes. This eliminates the need for manual steps like setting up CMake on Windows or configuring WebAssembly for frontend development—tasks that often derail onboarding.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome!

The project is designed so that large language models (LLMs) can assist in generating installation scripts for new tools. To contribute:

- Add a new installation definition file for the tool.
- Include any relevant context from the codebase.
- Confirm the tool installs and functions as expected.
- Submit a pull request with your changes.

## Running Locally
To run the app locally:
```bash
go run main.go
```

To enable verbose logging, run:

```bash
source scripts/enable_debug.sh
```
